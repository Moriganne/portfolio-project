    		My name is Morgan Nok-Boyle. I'm currently a junior at Oakland Highschool. This is my first year there after I transfered from American Indian Public Highschool. Why did I transfer? AI's leadership is terrible, the staff is rude and takes a lot of time and much pestering to help you get papers you need, and they didn't have any forms of sports. I feel for anyone who has to go there well into highschool.

    		I have grown up in Oakland and lived here my whole life, so far. I've definitely lived here long enough to watch gentrification slowly take over Oakland. Rent is going up and my family and I might even have to move. Hopefuly that day comes no time soon.

    		Growing up, I have done many things from many different kinds of dance like ballet and belly dance to rhythmic gymnastics and circus arts like flying trapeze and silks.
