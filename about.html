    	<p>
    		I enjoy surfing. I usually surf with a group called Brown Girls Surf. Everyone is super nice and one of the expeditions we went on was a cleanup. We went to the boating shop at Jack London to rent canoes and clean the estuary. I always enjoy my time with this group and I'm currently in thier riding leaders program. I get the opporitunity teach other people how to surf. A few people in this program and someone else at Gameheads introduced me to my new favorite hobby, longboarding. I've been teaching myself how to do dancing and it is something I very much enjoy.

    		Besides surfing and boarding, I also enjoy videogames. Most people wouldn't see this as note worthy but I took my love of videogames and turned it into something productive. This summer I created a team of 5 to creat a videogame. I did this with another program called Gameheads. We created a game that was later showcased at the Youth Impact Hub. Our group name is Xisessential, you can find us on twitter. The name of out game is Nobody's Home. We are now submitting Nobody's Home to competitions including an upcoming one with Google.
