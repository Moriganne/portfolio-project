    		About me
    	</h1>
    	<p>
    		I enjoy surfing. I usually surf with a group called Brown Girls Surf. Everyone is super nice and one of the expeditions we went on was a cleanup. We went to the boating shop at Jack London to rent canoes and clean the estuary. I always enjoy my time with this group and I'm currently in thier riding leaders program. I get the opporitunity teach other people how to surf. A few people in this program and someone else at Gameheads introduced me to my new favorite hobby, longboarding. I've been teaching myself how to do dancing and it is something I very much enjoy.

    		Besides surfing and boarding, I also enjoy videogames. Most people wouldn't see this as note worthy but I took my love of videogames and turned it into something productive. This summer I created a team of 5 to creat a videogame. I did this with another program called Gameheads. We created a game that was later showcased at the Youth Impact Hub. We are now submitting it to competitions including an upcoming one with Google.
